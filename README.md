## About <a name = "about"></a>

The application is a rest API that evaluates whether a number is odd or not.
Built with NodeJS and hosted on a Kops cluster (kubernetes). Using IaC patterns, the infrastructure was written with a mix of tools to launch better and be maintainable.

## üèÅ Getting started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Some of the steps can be different. The whole project was divided into modules to suit your preferences.

### Prerequisites

```
Ansible 2.10.4+
AWS credentials
Helm v3.4.0+
Kubernetes cluster (optional)
Python 3
Terraform 0.14.0+
```

### Modules

These steps are essential, but not immutable. You can customize some of them or just replace them, but you need to run them all to get the same result.

#### Step 1 - Application itself
\
#### Step 2 - CI pipeline
\
#### Step 3 - Cluster infrastructure
\
#### Step 4 - CD pipeline
\
#### Step 5 - Application IaC
